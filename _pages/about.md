I am currently an M.Sc. student in Computer Science at [the University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), Kelowna, Canada.
I am conducting research on VR locomotion under the co-supervision of Drs. [Khalad Hasan](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/) and [Patricia Lasserre](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/patricia-lasserre/).

I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Nazarbayev University](https://nu.edu.kz).
