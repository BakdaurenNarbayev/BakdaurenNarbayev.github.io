excerpt: 'This paper presents a CFD-based analysis of pedestrian wind comfort around the Tower of Qazaqstan in Astana (previously known as Nur-Sultan), Kazakhstan, using the incompressible time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations solved via the Finite Element Method. The simulations reveal variable wind velocity profiles that, in some areas, exceed acceptable comfort thresholds for pedestrians.'

Pedestrian wind comfort plays an essential role in the urban environment. In our work, we consider a model obtained using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) around a tall building. Our focus is the Tower of Qazaqstan or Abu Dhabi Plaza in Nur-Sultan city (Kazakhstan), which will be the tallest building in Central Asia with a height of 310.8 m. We investigated the effect of the wind velocity on pedestrians by solving the incompressible time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations in the deal.II library by the Finite Element Method (FEM) using the projection method. We present numerical simulation results for various scenarios. It has been found that the velocity profile can vary in the domain that creates different pedestrian comfort conditions including the exceeded category at places dedicated to pedestrian walking.
